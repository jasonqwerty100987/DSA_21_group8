## Idea
N-queen problem can be solved by many searching algoriths, and hill climbing and simulated annealing are two of them. However, we want to know that which one is faster and why it is faster than the other. Therefore, we built this project and provide our own analysis. 

## Requirement
To run our project, you first need to clone the main.py and nqueen.py to your local directory.
Furthermore, you need to install:

- numpy

- matplotlib

- pandas 


## To Run
There are multiple parameters that you can tunes with that are shown as comments in the main.py file.

After the parameters are tuned, you can run the project by
```
$ python main.py
```
